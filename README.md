**Run offline system update with pacman.**

The offline system update with pacman is achieved by integrating into
[offline updates in systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.offline-updates.html).
In fact only two scripts and a number of systemd unit files are used to
glue `systemd` and `pacman`.

Requirements
------------

There are the runtime dependencies:

* [pacman](https://archlinux.org/pacman/)
* [systemd](https://www.github.com/systemd/systemd)

And there's an optional dependency to support elevating privileges:

* [polkit](https://github.com/polkit-org/polkit)

Optional basic support for
[plymouth](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Plymouth/) is
integrated.

Usage
-----

A single command `pacman-offline` is used to prepare the offline update.
It accepts some arguments:

* *-a*: abort pending system-update
* *-c*: clean before download
* *-f*: force if other system-update is pending
* *-h*: show help
* *-p*: reboot, install and poweroff immediately
* *-r*: reboot and install immediately
* *-t*: start timer for nightly reboot
* *-y*: update sync databases

### Elevating privileges

The privileges are elevated automatically if `polkit` is installed. This works
with no authentication if your user is member of the group `wheel`. To add your
user to that group run:

    usermod --append --groups wheel user

If your user is not member of that group you will be asked for a password.

### Timer for preparation

You can enable a timer to prepare the offline update automatically.

    systemctl enable pacman-offline-prepare.timer

This will trigger several minutes after boot, then ever day. The databases
are synced, then packages are downloaded. The updates are installed when
ever the system reboots.

### Timer for nightly reboot

You can enable a timer for nightly reboot:

    systemctl enable pacman-offline-reboot.timer

This will trigger at night, if updates are pending and prepared.

Configuration
-------------

Two snippets for inclusion in `/etc/pacman.conf` are shipped. To make use of
them add these line:

    Include = /etc/pacman.d/offline.conf
    #Include = /etc/pacman.d/offline-include.conf

The first one will cause `pacman` to ignore linux packages and prevent
breaking module loading and hibernation. These packages are not ignored
on offline update.

The second one has the opposite effect, it is included on offline action
only.

Modify `/etc/pacman.d/offline.conf` and `/etc/pacman.d/offline-include.conf`
to your needs by changing or adding packages, or adding new directives.
